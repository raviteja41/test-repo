Install Apache Flink on Multi-node Cluster
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Follow the steps given below to install Apache Flink on multi-node cluster-

2.1. Platform
I. Platform Requirements

    Operating system: Ubuntu 14.04 or later, we can also use other Linux flavors like: CentOS, Redhat, etc.
    Java 7.x or higher


2.2. Prerequisites

I. Install Java 7.x or higher

NOTE: Install Java on all the nodes of the cluster


II. Configure SSH

SSH means secured shell which is used for the remote login. We can login to a remote machine using SSH. Now we need to configure passwordless SSH. Passwordless SSH means without a password we can login to a remote machine. Password less SSH setup is required for remote script invocation. Automatically remotely master will start the demons on slaves.

a. Install Open SSH Server-Client
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server openssh-client

b. Generate Key Pairs
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -P ""

It will ask “Enter the name of file in which to save the key (/home/dataflair/.ssh/id_rsa):” let it be default, don’t specify any path just press “Enter”. Now it will be available in the default path i.e. “.ssh”. To check the default path use command “$ls .ssh/” and you will see that two files are created “id_rsa” which is a private key and “id_rsa.pub” which is a public key.

c. Configure password-less SSH

Copy the contents of “id_rsa.pub” of master into the “authorized_keys” files of all the slaves and master
	
$ cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys

d. Check by SSH to all the hosts
$ ssh localhost
	
$ ssh <SLAVE-IP>

It should not ask for any password and you can easily get logged into remote machine since we have configured passwordless SSH

2.3. Install Apache Flink in Cluster Mode

I. Install Flink on Master
a. Download the Flink Setup

Download the Flink Setup from its official website http://flink.apache.org/downloads.html
b. Untar the file

In order to extract all the contents of compressed Apache Flink file package, use the below command:
	
dataflair@ubuntu:~$ tar xzf flink-1.1.3-bin-hadoop26-scala_2.11.tgz
c. Rename the directory

dataflair@ubuntu:~$ mv flink-1.1.3/ flink

d. Setup Configuration
i. Go to Flink conf directory
	
dataflair@ubuntu:~$  cd  flink
	
dataflair@ubuntu:~/flink$  cd  conf
ii. Add the entry of Master

Choose a master node (JobManager) and set the jobmanager.rpc.address in conf/flink-conf.yaml to its IP or hostname. Make sure that all nodes in your cluster have the same jobmanager.rpc.address configured.
	
dataflair@ubuntu:~/flink/conf$  nano flink-conf.yaml
Add this line: jobmanager.rpc.address: 192.168.1.3
iii. Add the entry of all the Slaves

Add the IPs or hostnames (one per line) of all worker nodes (TaskManager) to the slaves files in conf/slaves. To configure file use the following command.

dataflair@ubuntu:~/flink/conf$  nano slaves

Enter ip addresses like this –
192.168.1.4
192.168.1.5

II. Install Flink on Slaves
a. Copy configured setup from master to all the slaves

We will create a tar of configured Flink setup and copy it on all the slaves.
i. Create tar-ball of configured setup:
	
$ tar czf flink.tar.gz flink

NOTE: Run this command on Master
ii. Copy the configured tar-ball on all the slaves
	
$ scp flink.tar.gz 192.168.1.4:~
$ scp flink.tar.gz 192.168.1.5:~

NOTE: Run this command on Master
iii. Un-tar configured hadoop setup on all the slaves
	
$ tar xzf flink.tar.gz

NOTE: Run this command on all the slaves

2.4. Start that Flink Cluster
I. Start the cluster

To start the cluster run below script, it will start all the daemons running on master as well as slaves.
	
dataflair@ubuntu:~/flink/$ bin/start-cluster.sh

NOTE: Run this command on Master

II. Check whether services have been started
a. Check daemons on Master

$ jps
JobManager
b. Check daemons on Slaves
	
$ jps
TaskManager

Now the cluster has been setup successfully, you can play with the cluster..!!

III. Stop the cluster

To stop the cluster run below script, it will stop all the daemons running on master as well as slaves
	
dataflair@ubuntu:~/flink/$ bin/stop-cluster.sh
